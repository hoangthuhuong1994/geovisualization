			<h1>Flood Risk Mapping in Trier</h1>
			<!-- <h2>Definition</h2> -->
			<p>In this exercise, I employed various mapping techniques to describe Trier's flood risk. Leveraging my expertise, I crafted static maps presented as PNG files, dynamic GIF animations and interactive maps designed with GIS apllications.</p>			
			<h2>Trier</h2>
			<p>In the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Trier is a city steeped in history and has a privileged location within the Moselle wine region near the border of Luxembourg. The temperate climate zone, characterized by a pronounced.</p>
			<h2>Visualizations of the Trier city in QGIS</h2>

			</figure>
			<h2>Creating the Flood risk</h2>
			<p>Creating Flood Levels: Based on a reference flood event in December 1993, water levels are defined for animation, spanning from 124m to 133m (Normal Null) or as a range of 3m to 12m. This is done by extracting several water levels, using a 6-hour interval with a constant rise of 0.5m per step, resulting in 19 levels.</p>
			<p>The next steps, the geoprocessing with the python script Toolbox FloodTools.tbx are used to process, which includes "Extract Heights", "Flooded Features" and "Make Flood Time Mosaic".</p>
			<p>The tool "Extract Height" first is used to extracts height levels using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and stores the created raster. After that, the "Flooded Features" tool is used to determines the vector features within an extracted water level and assigns the water level to an feature attribute</p>
			<p>Below picture is the visualizations of the output:</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Exporting the map as an interactive web map through ArcGIS Online offers another method for sharing. By using ArcGIS Pro, the map can be uploaded to the online account associated with an ArcGIS organization. After the map is uploaded, it can be shared on a website through a link.</p>
			<p>To explore the interactive version of the map, click on the following button, which leads to the map hosted on ArcGIS Online:

			  </a>
			</p>
			<h2>2D-Animation of the Flood event</h2>
			<p>To enhance flood risk visualization, the "Make Flood Time Mosaic" is now used to assemble a Raster Mosaic with time attributes for creating time-lapse animations of flood events. This process involves transforming extracted raster data into a mosaic dataset that can visualise temporal changes, such as rising floodwaters.</p>
			<p>The animation setup includes essential map elements and utilises ArcGIS Pro's Animation framework for dynamic storytelling through camera movements and layer adjustments. A simulated camera movement enhances the viewer's experience by providing different perspectives of Trier during the flood, starting from the northeast and following the Moselle River southward.</p>

			<h2>3D-Animation of the Flood event</h2>
			<p>For the ultimate visualization, a 3D animation showcasing a flood event is developed. This involves generating a 3D scene and transferring essential layers into it. While the DEM and the flood mosaic layer remain in 2D for clarity, buildings are rendered in 3D to provide a realistic view of the impacted areas. To conserve memory, only buildings affected by the flood are displayed.</p>
